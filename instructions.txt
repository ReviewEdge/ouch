*In gsheets_tool.py, you may have to change the path of the client_secrets_file.json to /home/pi/MyPiServer/server/spotify_controller_repo/sample/client_secrets_file.json or wherever the file is located (the full path)

gsheets_tool:
pip3 install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib

	Authenticating the google api is a bit difficult.  First, you will need to go to console.developers.google.com and create a new project.
	Within the project, you will need to enable the Google Sheets API.  Then, you will need to click "manage" the Sheets API within the project.
	Next, go to "credentials" (on the far left). Under OAuth 2.0 Client IDs, there will be a download option for the current project.
	Download this file, and name it "client_secrets_file".  After downloading this file, move it to the /spotify_controller_repo/sample/ directory.
	Next, run the gsheets_tool module. 
	
	*Likely for Windows only: This may open an error page in the browser. If so, copy the incorrect redirect URI from the error page.
 	Open the console link that it tells you to visit, and paste in the redirect URI you copied as an authorized redirect URI and click save.
	WITHOUT stopping the code that is currently running, click the authorization link again. This will attempt to authorize again, but this time
	you have already entered the redirect URI, so it should work.

	Go through the authorization process, authorize the app with the account that the google sheets were created with (that you set up in config.py).
	After successful authorization, a "token.pickle" file will be created, and will save the authorization for the future.

*Sometimes a "refresh" error occurs with the google API authentication. So far, the best way I have found to adress this is to delete the token.pickle
file, and redo the authorization process described above.
